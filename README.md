# represearchproject1
This repository includes my project work for the coursera course reproducible research

Following files are relevant:
- PA1_template.Rmd : the R markdown file
- PA1_template.html : the html output file generated by knitr (Note that when opened in Github one gets the html source)
- PA1_ouput_in_pdf: the output file of knitr in pdf
